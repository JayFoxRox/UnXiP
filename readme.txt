UnXiP - by MaTiAz (modified by JayFoxRox)

Based on PIXIT 0.5 sources by Voltaic.

Description
===========
It just simply extracts an XIP archive. Nothing more.

Usage
=====

unxip.exe -extract [unxip-path] [default.xip]

Just type this in the console(not in the Xbox!!), or more familiar, The MS-DOS prompt.
But, remember to write the path for extracted files instead of [unxip-path] and
the desired XIP filename instead of [default.xip]!

About the sources
=================

I decided to give the sources out because Voltaic did it with PIXIT(and this
app is based on it!). Yes, it would be stupid to make a closed-source application
from a open-source one.

Compilation
===========

To compile and run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./unxip
```

Suggestions, bug reports and something other are welcome. EXCEPT SPAM!!

And im not a good coder so no suggestions like "You could port that tool to Linux/Solaris/
Xbox/Windows Codename Longhorn/blablaOS!" or "Why dont you make a gui for that tool?".
I can answer now to the last question, like this "Im not good coder(i dont understand
those WinMain things/Direct3D. I can make a front-end for it with VB but i dont
feel like it now so i let someone other guy do it."

Enjoy!!
